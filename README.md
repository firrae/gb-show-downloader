## This is BETA, don't expect perfection

Currently there is a settings file. Set your settings there. Currently only supports the Endurance Run, will add more shows as I verify things work and know the limitations of the API.

Requirements:
- Some CLI knowledege
- NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
- Some JSON knowledege

I will be looking to bundle it into an Electron app that is easier to use at some point.
